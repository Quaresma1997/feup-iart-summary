## Production Systems
Systems that describe a set of rules (*productions*) about behaviour. It represents a mechanism of goal finding through _if-then rules_ or _condition-action rules_ or _situation-action rules_ or just _productions_.


## Solution Searching Methods
  1. [Weak Methods](#Weak-Methods)
      * Generic search techniques
      * Subject to combinatorial explosion
  2. [Informed Methods](#Informed Methods)
      * Have some sort of prior knowledge about the problem
